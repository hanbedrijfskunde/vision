                <p>We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear.</p>

                <p>Just make a decision and let it go. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Let's have a little bit of fun today. Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long.</p>
                
                <p>Only eight colors that you need. Look at them little rascals. Maybe there's a happy little bush that lives right there. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.</p>
                
                <p>If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Let's get wild today.</p>

        <div class="item4">
                <p>That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Let's make a happy little mountain now. All kinds of happy little splashes. If we're going to have animals around we all have to be concerned about them and take care of them.</p>

                <p>Little short strokes. All those little son of a guns. A beautiful little sunset.</p>
                
                <p>God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it. And right there you got an almighty cloud. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. This is truly an almighty mountain. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying.</p>
                
                <p>There isn't a rule. You just practice and find out which way works best for you. We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. We can fix anything.</p>
                
                <p>I thought today we would do a happy little picture. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. Put it in, leave it alone. Do an almighty painting with us. See there how easy that is.</p>
